Scenario 1: Spike in bugs in new features
    Gather Data
        Break down bugs by category (UI, backend, integration)
        Map bugs to spec sections or requirements

    Immediate Mitigations
        Triage high-severity bugs, allocate hot-fix sprints
        Increase regression suite to cover areas with most defects

    Long-Term Solutions
        Shift-left Testing: involve QA in spec reviews and early design discussions
        Improve Specs: write clearer acceptance criteria and examples
        Automation: add smoke tests to catch show-stopper bugs before release
        Post-Mortem: document lessons learned and track action items


Scenario 2: Team resistance to automation
    Empathy & Communication
        Acknowledge team’s concerns about coding skills
        Share success stories and ROI of automation (time saved, fewer regressions)

    Training & Mentorship
        Organize hands-on workshops on an approachable tool (e.g., Cypress, Robot Framework)
        Pair experienced engineers with testers in “mob” or “pair” programming sessions

    Incremental Adoption
        Start with record-and-playback for simple smoke tests
        Gradually introduce scripting and parameterization

    Recognition & Motivation
        Celebrate each test automation milestone publicly
        Tie automation ownership to career growth or performance goals

    Tooling Choice
        Select a low-code-friendly framework (e.g., Playwright with recorders)
        Provide templates and examples to lower the barrier
